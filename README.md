# 🧩 Welcome to ProjectSource OSS — aka SourceRegistry 🇳🇱

> **Open Source, Intentionally Shared.**

ProjectSource OSS (hosted here as **SourceRegistry**) is the open-source initiative by [ProjectSource](https://projectsource.nl), a software company based in the Netherlands. We stand on the shoulders of the global open-source community — and we’re committed to giving back.

---

## 🤝 Our Commitment

We don’t open-source everything — but we *do* open-source **the tools that matter**.

These are projects we’ve built internally, polished, and intentionally released because:
- They solve real problems others might face.
- They can spark innovation or save time for fellow developers.
- They’re better when built *with* the community.

This is our thank-you to the OSS ecosystem that powers modern technology.

## 📦 What’s in the Registry?

You’ll find practical, production-tested tools including:
- Internal utilities we loved enough to share.
- Libraries that fill specific gaps we encountered.
- Tools designed for extensibility and community contribution.

👉 *Explore our pinned repositories to get started.*
